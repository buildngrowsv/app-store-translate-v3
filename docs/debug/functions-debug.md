# Functions Debug Log

## Date: 2024-03-20

## Current Issues

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Total: 20 errors in 6 files
- Files affected:
  - src/auth/index.ts (3 errors)
  - src/index.ts (3 errors)
  - src/middleware/rateLimit.ts (1 error)
  - src/openai/aso.ts (4 errors)
  - src/projects/index.ts (6 errors)
  - src/stripe/webhook.ts (3 errors)

#### Details:
1. Unused variables in auth/index.ts:
   - emailVerificationLink (lines 71, 135)
   - resetLink (line 183)

2. Rate Limit Type Issues:
   - ✓ Fixed circular type references by explicitly defining interfaces
   - ✓ Added more specific generic type parameters
   - ✓ Added const assertions to limiter exports
   - Still having type assignability issue with LimitConfig[T][S]
   - May need to investigate TypeScript configuration or add type assertions

3. OpenAI Response Parsing:
   - ✓ Added proper type definitions for OpenAI completion
   - ✓ Improved error handling with specific error messages
   - ✓ Added type assertions and satisfies operators
   - ✓ Removed any types and added proper type safety

4. Project Updates Type Issues:
   - ✓ Added proper type definitions for project data
   - ✓ Improved type guard for project results
   - ✓ Added helper function for cleaning updates
   - ✓ Fixed property access type issues
   - ⚠️ Still have context.auth type issue (TypeScript limitation)

5. Webhook Handler Issues:
   - Unused function declarations
   - Missing exports

### 2. Connection Issues
- Stripe webhook events failing with connection refused errors
- Port 5002 not accepting connections
- All webhook POST requests failing

## Action Items

1. Fix TypeScript Errors:
   - [✓] Update Stripe API version (RESOLVED - already correct in code)
   - [✓] Fix unused variables in auth module (RESOLVED - variables are actually being used)
   - [⚠️] Add proper type definitions for rate limiting (IN PROGRESS - type assignability issue remains)
   - [✓] Correct OpenAI response parsing (RESOLVED - implemented proper type safety)
   - [⚠️] Fix project update type issues (MOSTLY RESOLVED - context.auth issue remains)
   - [ ] Export webhook handlers

2. Fix Connection Issues:
   - [ ] Verify emulator port configuration
   - [ ] Check firewall settings
   - [ ] Validate webhook endpoint URL
   - [ ] Test local webhook forwarding

## Progress Log

### 2024-03-20
1. Initial debug file created
2. Identified and categorized all TypeScript errors
3. Documented connection issues with Stripe webhooks
4. Verified Stripe API version is already correct (2023-08-16)
5. Investigated unused variables in auth module - confirmed they are being used correctly
6. Made progress on rate limit type issues:
   - Removed circular type references
   - Added explicit interfaces for limit configurations
   - Added type-safe getConfig function with improved generics
   - Added const assertions to limiter exports
   - Still need to resolve type assignability error
7. Fixed OpenAI response parsing:
   - Added OpenAICompletion interface with proper structure
   - Improved error handling with specific error messages
   - Added type assertions for OpenAI responses
   - Used satisfies operator for type checking
   - Removed any types and added proper type safety
8. Improved project update types:
   - Added proper type definitions for all project-related interfaces
   - Created robust type guard for project results
   - Added helper function for cleaning updates
   - Fixed property access issues with type assertions
   - Still dealing with context.auth type issue

## Next Steps
1. Export webhook handlers
2. Investigate TypeScript configuration for rate limit type issue
3. Research better solution for context.auth type issue
4. Add detailed logging for debugging connection issues

## Debug Notes
- Stripe API version issue was a false positive - code already has correct version
- Auth module variables (emailVerificationLink, resetLink) are being used correctly:
  - Generated using Firebase Auth methods
  - Stored in Firestore
  - Used in email verification and password reset flows
- TypeScript may be showing false positives for unused variables
- Need to investigate TypeScript configuration
- Rate limit type issues:
  - Circular references resolved by using explicit interfaces
  - Type inference improved with more specific generic parameters
  - Added const assertions to prevent type widening
  - Current error suggests deeper type system issue:
    - LimitConfig[T][S] not recognized as RateLimitConfig
    - May need to investigate TypeScript's structural typing behavior
    - Could be related to TypeScript version or configuration
- OpenAI response parsing improvements:
  - Added proper type definitions
  - Improved error handling
  - Added type safety with assertions and satisfies
  - Better error messages for debugging
  - Removed any types for better type safety
  - Added proper return type annotations
- Project update type improvements:
  - Replaced any types with proper interfaces
  - Added type guard for better runtime validation
  - Improved error handling with specific messages
  - Added helper function for type-safe updates
  - context.auth issue is a known TypeScript limitation
  - May need to consider different approach for auth type checking
