# System Overview

## Architecture

ReachMix is a React-based web application that provides AI-powered app store optimization and translation services. The application follows a modern single-page application (SPA) architecture with the following key characteristics:

- Client-side routing using React Router
- Context-based state management
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- OpenAI integration for AI-powered features

## Key Components

### Frontend Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented using React Context (`AuthContext`)
   - Handles user registration, login, and session management
   - Currently uses in-memory storage (needs to be replaced with proper backend)

2. **Project Wizard**
   - Multi-step form for project creation
   - Handles both enhancement and translation projects
   - Components:
     - `ProjectWizard`: Main wizard container
     - `ProjectDetails`: Basic project information
     - `ProjectType`: Project type selection
     - `LanguageSelection`: Target language selection

3. **Results System**
   - Displays generated content and translations
   - Handles copying and saving results
   - Components:
     - `ResultsView`: Main results display
     - `ProjectResults`: Results page container

4. **Internationalization**
   - Supports 15 languages for the interface
   - Uses a custom translation system
   - Handles RTL languages (Arabic)

### Core Services

1. **OpenAI Service**
   - Handles communication with OpenAI API
   - Processes both enhancement and translation requests
   - Implements retry logic and error handling

2. **Authentication Service**
   - Manages user authentication
   - Handles project creation and updates
   - Currently uses in-memory storage (temporary)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Lucide Icons

### State Management
- React Context API
- Custom hooks for state access

### AI Integration
- OpenAI API
- Custom prompt engineering
- Result processing and formatting

### Development Tools
- Vite (Build tool)
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- Git

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Client-Side Architecture**
   - Single-page application for better user experience
   - React for component-based development
   - TypeScript for type safety

2. **State Management**
   - React Context for global state
   - Chosen for simplicity and built-in React integration
   - Suitable for current application scale

3. **Styling**
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Custom components for consistent design
   - Responsive design principles

4. **AI Integration**
   - OpenAI API for natural language processing
   - Custom prompts for specific use cases
   - Asynchronous processing with status tracking

## Future Considerations

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace in-memory storage with proper backend
   - Implement proper authentication system
   - Add API rate limiting and caching

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add proper authentication
   - Implement API key management
   - Add request validation
