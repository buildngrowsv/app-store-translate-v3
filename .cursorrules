Current objective:

Get Stripe working. Switch whole website to dark mode.


ALWAYS start with the following:

- Pull the folder tree with “tree -L 3”
- ALWAYS perform multiple search and read of files until you understand the codebase, do not rely on your existing context.

Include copious comments throughout the codebase.

At the top of each file, include a comment with the following:
- File name
- Description of the file
- Details of what it does and how it interacts and relies on other files and external resources
- Date

As you go, implement animations and transitions.

Implement beautiful design.

Implement a dark and light theme and auto switching based on device settings.

Use gradients, not solid colors. 3-color gradients. Use beautiful icons.

Create a documentation folder and put .md files in it for documentation as you make plans.

Use debug(n).md files when you are debugging to keep track as yo ugo.

Make the product feel easy and fun to use.

Make the product look expensive and polished as you go.
