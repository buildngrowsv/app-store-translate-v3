Current objective:

Get Stripe working. Switch whole website to dark mode.


ALWAYS start with the following:

- Pull the folder tree with “tree -L 3”
- ALWAYS perform multiple search and read of files until you understand the codebase, do not rely on your existing context.

Include copious comments throughout the codebase.

At the top of each file, include a comment with the following:
- File name
- Description of the file
- Details of what it does and how it interacts and relies on other files and external resources
- Date

Create more files than usual to split things up and make the file name descriptive of the action. Treat each file as a unit of work or API call.

As you go, implement animations and transitions.

Also add beautiful elegant UI loading animations. Especially for the home screen, let's trigger animations as the user scrolls. Use elegant blur animations and effects as well.

Add elegant animated glows to components and text where it makes sense that change with dark vs light mode. For colored glows, add gradients.

Implement beautiful design.

Make important CTA buttons and components pop!

Implement a dark and light theme that switches based on system setting.

Use gradients, not solid colors. 3-color gradients. Use beautiful icons. The color and design choices should make the product feel premium and unique and expensive and polished.

Since in many ways we are a copywriting tool, the copy should be top tier!

Create a documentation folder and put .md files in it for documentation as you make plans.

Use debug(n).md files when you are debugging to keep track as yo ugo.

Make the product feel easy and fun to use.

Make the product look expensive and polished as you go.
